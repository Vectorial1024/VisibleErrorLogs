A handy mini-mod to pop up the error log when an error is printed, regardless of dev-mode settings, for better situational awareness, just as our predecessors have experienced.

[h1]Mod Features[/h1]
When dev-mode is enabled, whenever an error message is printed (aka "red text", "exception", "Log.Error", etc etc), the debug log will appear. This is very helpful to resolve bugs in a modded playthrough, but will require enabling the dev-mode, which some may not want to.

Seeing the error message printed can be a helpful thing, especially when you encounter unexplainable bugs. Having a log is good evidence to be given to the modders to find out what exactly went wrong.

This mod works very well with e.g. Mod Error Checker https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877266511 for dealing with mod errors on game startup. 

[h1]Should I Use This Mod?[/h1]
You should think about your "debugging policy".

Users may want to individually install this mod to verify their modlist stability, and to easily detect serious bugs without enabling dev-mode.

Modders may recommend using this mod so problems are detected asap. Note that most of the time, this mod belongs to the "dev-require" category, but not the "require" category, so actually requiring this mod in About.xml may not be the best move.

Bottom line: ask yourself whether you want to hunt down bugs and then decide.
