## Dev (WIP)

## 1.1.0 (2025-07-12)
Declare compatibility with RimWorld 1.6. The DLL for RW 1.5 is compatible with RW 1.6 with no problems.
- Added a simple button in the mod options panel to trigger a harmless error, so you know this mod is really working
- Fixed the mod not really using the intended RW 1.5 DLL for RimWorld 1.5

## 1.0.1 (2024-05-25)
Backported to RimWorld versions 1.3 and 1.4. Backported versions are stable and will not receive updates.

## 1.0.0 (2024-05-18)
Initial release.

Players are notified of runtime/config errors by simply showing the error log to the user regardless of dev-mode settings.
